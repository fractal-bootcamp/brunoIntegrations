From FrontEnd to BackEnd
-Not going too deep into FrontEnd layouts-

We will click a button and save a numeric value into a database.

1. I click a button in ClickButton component. That change of state stored in a variable gets send
by the function that is triggered by an event listener onClick.

2. Folder API: A function that handles a route ('/example-route') and that triggers a request and a response.

nameFunction = async (input) => {
    check Token

    try

        await fetch('/route', {
            method:
            headers:
        },
        body:
            )


        if (!response.ok)

        else
        result = await response.json()
        return result

    catch(error)

}
